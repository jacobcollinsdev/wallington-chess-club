                <p>
                    Wallington & Carshalton Chess Club was founded in 1895. It has been a constant member of the Surrey County Chess Association and has entered teams in the Surrey League for many years. <br><br>
                    We have five teams in competitive leagues and an internal club championship. Our adult and junior club nights are Wednesday evenings, and we welcome players of all ages and abilities. <br><br>
                    The club is open all Wednesdays except for all of August when it is closed, and for the last two weeks in December when it is closed.
