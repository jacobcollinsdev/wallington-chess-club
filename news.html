                        The start of a new decade sees a record of over 50 players at the club in one evening. Many were juniors, as there is now both a 6.15 to 7.15  and a 7.30 to 8.30 junior sesion. But also the Presidents cup has started with 7 games on 8th January.

                        With half term the webmaster is catching up on the news. The Junior Chess Club is proving to be very popular with 36 attending last week. There is now a 2 week 'half term' before restarting on Wednesday 6th November, when they will play in Leagues. <br><br>

                        The senior club had a short run in the Lauder Cup - losing away to Kingston, with just Neill and Armel getting draws.

                        The first fixture of the season was a tough one against a strong Streatham team. Nick and then Alan got early draws but then four other players lost before at the very end Armel got our third draw. So a loss 1.5 - 5.5 to continue our losing run in the Surrey League. <br><br>

                        The junior club continues to flourish with 26 nine to fifteen year olds attemding last week.

                        Plenty of results since the last update, and we're not finished yet even if the league season is. First off, yet another near-miss in the Surrey League: 3-4 against the division winners Guildford 2, that really could have been more; Neill, Armel, Geoff and Jim all drew, with Nick grabbing a good win, but yet again it was not to be. A disappointing season to say the least, but hopefully we'll be back where we belong soon. <br><br>

                        The Croydon League also ended in a bit of a whimper for us as our title defence fell short - after a 2-2 draw with CCF courtesy of wins from Robert and Peter, we lost 1-3 to Streatham with only another Robert win sparing our blushes. <br><br>

                        The webmaster's prediction about the President's Cup came to pass, with Group A ending in a play-off between the top three seeds. In the end it was Alan and Neill (in that order) who came through, and they go on to face Steve and Nick respectively in the semi-finals. The first game in each match ended drawn, with the second to be played next week. Dare I say we may not be done with play-offs yet... <br><br>

                        And finally, a date for your diaries: the club AGM will be on 19th June.

                    <p>
                        Newer readers won't know, but the webmaster used to be so good at updating this page promptly. No longer...  Anyway, a chunky update for you all this time, but not the most cheery. We've had two heavy losses in the Surrey League this month - 1½-5½ against Kingston (Alan won and Steve drew) followed by 1-6 against Streatham (draws from Nick and Alan). Both clubs fielded very strong teams against us, but the league has got a lot stronger this season and we have simply been left behind. So let's see how we get on in the Ellam Trophy next season... <br><br>

                        Group A of the President's Cup is shaping up for a tense conclusion; Alan and Neill drew earlier this week which means that a three-way playoff between them and Armel for the two knockout spots is a real possibility. Watch this space... <br><br>

                        Lastly, we now have full Croydon League results for the season to date - with two wins and a draw from four matches, we are still in the running to retain the title we won last year. Truly a tale of two leagues!

                    <p>
                        Probably the biggest news of the moment is that the webmaster has an internet connection again, so can make a small update. Whilst there are murmurs that we may have beaten West Wickham in the Croydon League, the only hard-and-fast result is our latest loss in the Surrey League against Wimbledon 3 - a club that we can just never beat! Neill was our only winner on the night, with Nick and Jim drawing. <br><br>

                        That leaves us with an uphill struggle to stay in the Beaumont Cup for next season, but we will know soon, since the team will be blitzing out its remaining three fixtures in March.

                    <p>
                        New-year greetings are out of fashion now, so let's jump into the news. We have had two recent Croydon League matches (although match cards are unavailable for the time being) first drawing 2-2 with a strong Lewisham team - Alan had a good win, with draws for Robert and Melissa - but then losing 1-3 to South Norwood despite Alan and Jacob chipping in halves. It could easily have been more, but that's the story of our season so far...<br><br>

                        In the President's Cup we are well on the way to completing the schedule, with results trickling in every week - Nick has now completed his clean sweep of Group B and will be joined by Steve; Group A still awaits the decisive clashes between the leaders with four players in contention. <br><br>

                        New ECF grades came out earlier this month - we can welcome Alan and Arthur onto the list at 159 and 154 respectively, whilst Henry made the biggest gain of the term.

                    <p>
                        It has been a quiet month and a half, but a few bits and pieces to update on. Both of our teams have been in action recently; in the Surrey League we had another disappointingly close defeat, away to Surbiton 3 this time, despite strong wins for Nick, Alan and Arthur, who is continuing to do remarkably for someone who had never played competitively before this season. Meanwhile, word on the street is that we had a 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace in the Croydon League - hopefully a match card will wend its way to the webmaster soon.<br><br>

                        The President's Cup players have been busy, and the groups are beginning to take shape. Nick has stormed to 4/4 and is already assured of one of the semi-final spots; in the other group Neill and Alan lead the way but the top seeds have been avoiding each other so far! <br><br>

                        We will be running a blitz evening tomorrow for our last meeting of the year - if any members who want to play haven't let me know then please do so, otherwise it only remains to wish all of our readers a happy Christmas and prosperous new year.

                        So near and yet so far once again for our first team against Surbiton 2. Things didn't look good when we saw their teamsheet, but fought hard and deserved to come away with something - Armel won against a 42-point grading handicap, with Nick, Stephen and especially Henry all getting good draws. Sadly it wasn't quite enough, and whilst Alan's game is going to the adjudicators with the score at 2½-3½ as things stand, it will be a draw at best so we have lost the match. <br><br>

                        Some early President's Cup results are in - no upsets yet, although it was close in some cases...

                        There's been plenty of action to report over the last 3 weeks. Firstly, we've played South Norwood in both the Beaumont Cup and the Lauder Trophy... and lost both times! In the Lauder the score was 2½-3½ (Neill, Armel and Steve drew, with Gregory winning) and in the Beaumont 2½-4½ (Neill, Geoff and Arthur drew, with Armel our lone winner) - but on both occasions it could have been so much more... <br><br>

                        Croydon League fixtures are now available; we are attempting to defend the Dave Luckin Trophy (Division 3) and begin our campaign at home to Crystal Palace on 14th November. <br><br>

                        Details of the President's Cup for this year can now be found on the relevant page. There are two APA groups, with the top four players proceeding to a knockout stage. Neill and Nick look like the heavy favourites but this competition has a habit of throwing up strange results! If anyone else wants to play then there is still room, but be aware that the first round should be completed by the end of this month. <br><br>
                        
                        Last but not least, the <a href="http://www.surreychesscongress.co.uk/" target="_blank">Surrey Chess Congress</a> is returning after many years, and will be at Kingston University from 26th-28th October. There are three sections (FIDE Open, FIDE U1900+U160, ECF U130) and all are welcome - see you there!

                        We are off and running! Our first match of the new season was tonight in the Alexander Cup, at home against CCF. Fielding a competitive team across 10 boards is always a challenge but we were able to put up a good fight before going down 3½-6½. Steve and his son Arthur both won, with Neill (in his first game for the club), Kevin (in his last before he goes off to study at Cambridge) and Robert all having exciting draws with strong opponents which they were unlucky not to win. We weren't far off an upset in the end, but the good news is that we get to try again as early as next week, when we'll be welcoming South Norwood for another cup match in the Lauder Trophy. <br><br>

                        In tournament news, Wallington were represented in the recent UK Blitz Championships by both the webmaster (who scored a respectable 8½/15 in the very tough London qualifier) and Sylvia, who scored 7½/15 in Birmingham and was only a whisker away from qualifying for the Women's Final - see the <a href="https://www.englishchess.org.uk/uk-open-blitz-report-2018/" target="_blank">ECF website</a> for a picture report. <br><br>

                        Lastly, Owen is taking on the organising of the President's Cup for this season and promises me that exciting changes are afoot - more news as it comes in!

                        September is here, and that can only mean a new chess season is upon us! Results and news for 2017-18 have been archived, and details for the new season are appearing as they trickle in. Our team entries are unchanged; our 1st team will be playing in the Surrey League's Beaumont Cup and the Alexander Cup competition, and we have a 2nd team in the Croydon League's Dave Luckin Trophy. Surrey League fixtures are already available - as it stands, we kick off with a cup match at home against CCF on 26th September. <br><br>
